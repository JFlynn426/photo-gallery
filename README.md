In this assignment I was asked to create a react app from a json file that would correctly display the images that I was asked to use. I had just learned to use react-router to create a page with subpages that could successfully be navigated through. I learned how to use react router to create the multipage layout while referencing a json object. These skills would work out well to create multipage layouts that can display information from an api call with minimal coding using the react-router library.
